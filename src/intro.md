### Acknowledgements and Contributions

In the creation of this guide for the Sui Move programming language, significant contributions have been made by two exceptional developers, without whom this book would not have been possible in its current depth and scope.

I extend my sincere thanks to [Porkbrain](https://github.com/bausano) and [Suficio](https://github.com/Suficio) for their collaboration and invaluable contributions in co-developing the advanced patterns in this guide.

In addition, I extend my gratitude to [Damir](https://github.com/damirka), the creator of the [Move Book](https://move-book.com/) and [Sui by Example](https://examples.sui.io/), whom we had the pleasure to work with side by side co-developing the Hot Potato Request pattern (i.e rolling hot potato) during the development of the Kiosk standard.
